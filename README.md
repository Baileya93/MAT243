# NBA Team Performance Analysis Project

# Overview
This project aims to assist the coach and management of the Lakers NBA team in making data-driven decisions to improve overall team performance. By analyzing and comparing historical performance data of the Lakers (2013-2015) and the Bulls (1996-1998), we provide actionable insights through statistical analysis and data visualization.

# Problem Statement
The primary objective is to analyze the points per game and points allowed by opponents for both teams to identify performance trends and areas for improvement. The analysis focuses on descriptive statistics, data visualization, and comparative analysis to support strategic decision-making.

# Data Sets
Lakers: Points per game and points allowed (2013-2015)
Bulls: Points per game and points allowed (1996-1998)

# Statistical Methods
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation, variance
Data Visualization: Scatterplots, boxplots
Comparative Analysis: Comparing distributions and performance trends

#Project Steps

1. Team Selection:

    Chosen Team: Lakers (2013-2015)
    Assigned Team: Bulls (1996-1998)
   
2. Data Visualization:

  Created scatterplots to visualize the distribution of points scored per game for both teams.
  Used boxplots to compare the performance distributions between the two teams.
  
3. Descriptive Statistics:

   Calculated mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for points scored in home and away games.
   Summarized statistics to interpret team performance and consistency.

4. Confidence Intervals:

  Calculated 95% confidence intervals for the average relative skill of all NBA teams during the specified years.
  Analyzed the probability of a given team having a relative skill level less than that of the Lakers and Bulls.

# Key Findings
Lakers' Performance: Consistent scoring pattern with higher average points per game compared to the Bulls.
Bulls' Performance: Despite a few outliers, the team maintained an average scoring performance.
Comparative Insights: The Lakers demonstrated a more consistent and slightly higher-scoring performance than the Bulls.
